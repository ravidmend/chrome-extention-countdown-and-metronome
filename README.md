# chrome-extention-countdown-and-metronome

This Chrome extension is for guitar players who want a few seconds to set up before starting to play along with YouTube videos. It activates only after pressing the button, ensuring it won't interrupt you when you're not playing. The extension allows users to start a countdown before playing the video and includes a metronome to adjust the beats per minute (BPM) to match the video's tempo.

## Features

- **Start Countdown:** Pause the video and start a countdown timer to give you time to get ready.
- **Metronome:** Adjust the beats per minute (BPM) to match the video's tempo.
- **Close Button:** Easily hide the control bar and stop the metronome.
